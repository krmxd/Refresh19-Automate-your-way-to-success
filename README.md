I hope you enjoyed refresh19 as much as I did.

## How to use this repo

### Requirements
We've decided to build this starterkit based on Azure Functions and make use of Powershell.

Azure Functions because it's free! 
Get your free account [here] (https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

Powershell mostly because it's not that hard to start with and has a great community to help out with any question.
Read more on powershell [here] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-6) if you are new to Powershell. And yes, Mac and Linux users aren't left out. 

### Step 1. Get your free Azure account running
Signup using the link above. Without a Azure subscription we can't move forward.
